                <h2>Leonel Ramirez</h2>
                <p>As a student pursuing a degree in Civil Engineering with a background in computer science, I have set ambitious goals for myself and have worked hard to achieve them. Throughout my academic career, I have consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic and a commitment to excellence.</p>
                <p>In high school, I was honored to be named salutatorian, a testament to my dedication and hard work. I have continued to excel in college, maintaining a 3.9 GPA and earning accolades such as the President's List (x2) and Dean's List (x3). Additionally, I have been actively involved in extracurricular organizations such as the American Society for Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS).</p>
                <p>I am also deeply committed to research, particularly in the area of facial emotion recognition. As a research assistant for the National Science Foundation CREST Center for Multidisciplinary Research Excellence in Cyber-physical Infrastructure Systems (MECIS) lab at UTRGV, I have gained valuable experience working with cutting-edge technology and contributing to important research projects. This summer, I had the opportunity to attend a REU at Riverside University, where I studied tensor methods to improve neural networks.</p>
                <p>My ultimate goal is to leverage my knowledge and experience to work for a car manufacturer, specifically Tesla, where I hope to work in the autonomous vehicles team. I am extremely interested in the intersection of technology and humans, and I believe that artificial intelligence will play a crucial role in the development of self-driving cars and other game-changing systems.</p>
                <p>My academic achievements, research experience, and passion for technology and AI, have set me on a path towards achieving my goal of working on autonomous vehicles, specifically at Tesla. I am confident that the skills and experience I have gained thus far will serve me well as I continue to pursue my goal.</p>
