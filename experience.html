            <ul>
              <li>Investigated Tensor Dropout methods in the context of Convolutional Neural Networks for computer vision tasks as it has been shown to increase robustness and ability to learn from noisy and/or adversarial data, while reaping the compression benefits of tensor methods.</li>
              <li>Experimented with novel ways to conduct tensor dropout and regularization within the same framework, and measured the effects of our methods in existing benchmark datasets</li>
